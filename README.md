## Purpose

A suite of scripts and functions developed and used in production environments for several years.  
They are listed here mainly for reference and because I got tired of rewriting them all the time as
I switch jobs.

## Description

### WORK IN PROGRESS

## Usage

From your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` scripts, execute the loader:

``` bash
source ~/.bsfpe/loader.sh
```
