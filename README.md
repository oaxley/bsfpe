# Bash Scripts for Production Environment (BSFPE)

## Description

This repository contains a suite of scripts and functions in Python or Bash that I developed along
the years and extensively used production environment. They use only standard *nix commands as well
as a little bit of python (but no fancy libraries).  
The goal is to left production servers as bare as they can be.

As there are no secrets or trademarks involved, and they rely only on common "development" sense,
I'm giving them for free, as it might help others having the same issues/requirements.
