# Bash Scripts for Production Environment (BSFPE)

## Description

This repository contains a suite of scripts and functions in Python or Bash that I developed along
the years and extensively used production environment.

As there are no secrets or trademarks involved, and they rely only on common "development" sense,
I'm giving them for free, as it might help others having the same issues/requirements.
